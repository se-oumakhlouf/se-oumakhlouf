# Hi there, I'm Selym! 👋

**Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Master's Student**

Based in Paris, France, I am currently pursuing a Master's in **Software & Data Engineering** at Gustave Eiffel University. I bridge the gap between robust Java backends and responsive modern frontends.

Currently, I'm building scalable full-stack solutions as an Apprentice at **Act-On Technology**.
